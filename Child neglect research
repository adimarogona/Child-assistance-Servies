neglect could be:
failure to give things that child needs to survive, like food

failure to provide necessary medical treatment

failure to educate child or provide special education needs

inattention to a child’s
emotional needs, failure to provide
psychological care, or permitting the
child to use alcohol or other drugs

leaving the child alone in a potentially dangerous situation with no contact for long periods of time

signs from the parent:
 Denies the existence of—or blames the
child for—the child’s problems in school
or at home
• Asks teachers or other caregivers to use
harsh physical discipline if the child
misbehaves
• Sees the child as entirely bad, worthless,
or burdensome
• Demands a level of physical or academic
performance the child cannot achieve
• Looks primarily to the child for care,
attention, and satisfaction of the parent’s
emotional needs
• Shows little concern for the child

signs from the child: 
• Is overly compliant, passive, or
withdrawn
• Comes to school or other activities early,
stays late, and does not want to go home
• Is reluctant to be around a particular
person
• Discloses maltreatment 
• Shows sudden changes in behavior or
school performance
• Has not received help for physical or
medical problems brought to the parents’
attention
• Has learning problems (or difficulty
concentrating) that cannot be attributed
to specific physical or psychological
causes
• Is always watchful, as though preparing
for something bad to happen
• Lacks adult supervision
