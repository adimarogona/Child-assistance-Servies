<h2 style=text-align:center;> “Childhood should be carefree, playing in the sun; not living a nightmare in the darkness of the soul.” 
― Dave Pelzer, A Child Called "It"</h2>

<h4 style=text-align:center;> Why did we choose to prevent child abuse? </h4>

<p>"For me, I wanted to specifically do child abuse because I have seen abuse in my family not only in children but also in women.
Growing up, I saw my cousin getting abused by her father physically and emotionally. He would hit her for no reason and not just a slight
touch it was anger beating he would make her bleed. He would also say that they were not his children and basically say things that no 
little kid should listen or go through. I was terrified of her father for all the things I saw him do and never really processed it when 
I was little I would only see it. My aunt was also extremely abused by her husband both emotionally and physically too. He would hit her 
and everyday he would go out and hang out with women not caring for her and that made her fall in depression and suicidal thoughts. This
is why I am so passionate on anti-abuse and helping families all around to prevent such things." -Joselin </p>

<p>"I wanted to do a website for preventing child abuse because I care about children. I have a ten year old sister, I’m in a club that
teaches children, and I coach a children’s soccer team. I believe all children should be able to live a life without anybody physically
or emotionally hurting them. Especially the members of their family. Children should be able to focus on growing up instead of worrying
if they are safe at home. I may not have any experiences of seeing child abuse, but I know it is a horrible thing that needs to stop."
-Chloe</p>

<p>"I want to do something that helps the community. I work a lot with children when I volunteer at the library and believe childhood is
one of the most important parts in someone’s life and want to make sure as many children as possible are able to experience a good and he
althy childhood. Just thinking of what some people do to their children makes me sad, sick, and angry. No child should ever have to deal
with that. In Greece, my home country, I hear many stories of child abuse and how there are parents beating children right in front of 
hospitals with no shame. I never want to see or hear about this happening again but the sad truth is, unless I actively try to help, things 
will not change. That is why I joined this project to try and do whatever I can to help."-Ariadne</p>

<p>"Child abuse has been a common issue all around the world and the children are the one that are often suffering because of the abuse
they are suffering. I have always had a type of attachment for kids because they are really innocent and pure. They are vulnerable and 
they are unable to protect themselves because they are young and always believe that kids would lie about stuff, but we need to be able
to protect the kids. It’s really painful to hear that kids that just want and need love are being mistreated without a specific reason.
I have younger family members and whenever I hear about those cases it breaks me in the inside and motivates me to find a way to stop all
the aggression that is going against the children. I was a child once and I loved to play, but while growing up I kept noticing that there 
are more kids that can’t have that happiness because they are suffering. This is a topic that people don’t want to touch, but they are 
children that don’t deserve that pain that’s given to them for no reason. We need to be able to help them and show them that they are not 
alone and that there are more people that want to protect them."-Anilu</p>
