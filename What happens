Children are important for our furture and when they are young it isrealy easy to take of advantage of them since they are 
vulnerable and unable to speak by themselves, so we need to prtotect them. There are people that are afraid to report child abuse
because they are afraid of what may happen to them if the person finds out that they reported the abuse, but they should know that if
they reported child abuse they will be protected by the law from civil or crimainal liability. The way that child abuse is detected is
if the child is:
    - Inhured by other than accidental means.
    - Subjected to willful cruelty or unjustificable punishment.
    - Abused or exploited sexually.
    - Neglected by a parent or caretaker who fails to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care or supervision.
